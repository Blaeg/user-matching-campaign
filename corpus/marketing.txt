Today, millennials make up 25% of the U.S. population (that’s 77 million people), and their economic spending power is $1.3 trillion dollars, according to PTTOW. In order to sell millennials on a product, concept or service, marketers have to connect with them on an emotional level that aligns with their complex value sets surrounding socioeconomic conditions and new cultural norms. In the past decade, one of the most helpful tools used to address the nonlinear path to connecting with this demographic has been music. See also: 11 Tips and Tricks for Spotify Power Users Music is powerful because it is content, and it stimulates social interaction and drives loyalty. Disruptive streaming technologies and the onset of multi-screen user behavior have forced drastic shifts in the use of music as a marketing tool by music labels, entertainment companies and brands across multiple consumer categories.

Twitter appears to be experimenting with a new mobile ad feature with two World Cup advertisers, Visa and Adidas. The feature, which Twitter had apparently tested with the film A Million Ways to Die in the West last month, lets you easily share a video ad when you use a hashtag. For instance, if you type "#visa" and then a space, you should see a paper clip prompt in your Twitter iOS app. Click on the icon and you can attach a video, which is an ad for Visa.

For those already on Twitter, the service can often feel like the entire world is listening — but with user growth tapering off, that's not quite accurate.

During the Super Bowl, RadioShack ran an ad showing two red-shirted workers. One answers the phone and looks troubled. Then we hear the receiver click. "What?" asks the other. "The '80s called," the employee replies. "They want their store back." By the looks of it, they may get it soon. Despite a new program that offers same-day repairs for smartphones, RadioShack turned in some dismal first-quarter numbers including a $98.3 million loss and a 14% drop in revenues, marking the ninth consecutive quarter that sales fell at the chain See also: Ring Up the Past With These Vintage RadioShack Cellphone Ads Read more...More about Radioshack, Business, and Marketing

Quick, avert your eyes, automatonophobes! Even if you don’t suffer from an irrational fear of wax figures, mannequins and ventriloquist dummies, you might get the willies after watching a new commercial for Colorado-based FirstBank. The ad, called Bargain Dummy, sends a creepy wooden doll home with a clueless yard sale shopper. Why was it free? Oh, he’ll find out. The 30-second spot, running on national broadcast and cable TV and across digital platforms like Hulu, ESPN, Yahoo and Pandora, is an example of spine-tingling marketing for brands as diverse as radial tires, ice cream shops, cell phones and house paint.

Line, the Japanese messaging app with more than 450 million users, has a message for the ad world: We're open for business. The service, which is reportedly considering an IPO, announced a partnership Monday with Salesforce.com that would let advertisers target users via the service. Marketers have already had the ability to reach consumers on Line, but Salesforce now lets them include the messaging app in a dashboard with a suite of apps. The upshot: Line and possibly other messaging services may become just another channel for marketers, along with Facebook, Twitter and search For marketers, the new dashboard will look like this: Read more...More about Business, Advertising, and Marketing

If Wayne Rooney wasn't a footballer, he'd probably be a fisherman. But the only way he wouldn't be a footballer is if the clones took over. Nike's latest ad, "The Last Game," in support of World Cup fever takes on a similar premise to the latest dystopian sci-fi movie. It pits man vs. the "perfect" clone — a soccer player that performs like a machine and is, supposedly, unbeatable. But they're missing one thing: heart (or, as Nike puts it, the willingness to take risks). It's sort of like a Gattaca that substitutes soccer for space travel See also: 32 Outstanding World Cup Names (and How to Pronounce Them) Read more...More about Soccer, Business, Ad, Advertisement, and Commercial

Thanks to a new innovation from Domino's it's a great time to be a pizza consumer, but not so great to be a pizza deliverer As this video shows, the fast food chain is applying physics principles to pizza delivery to ensure your pie doesn't arrive resembling a regurgitated hunk of lasagna. In particular, this nifty design "uses two 'hemispheres' fixed on X and Y axes, with pendulums of lead to compensate for the movement of the bike," as Creativity Online explains. For the layman, it sort of resembles a gyroscope While this is great news for consumers in Brazil where the "Steady Pizza" contraption is available, spare a moment to pity the drivers who have to strap it to the backs of their motorbikes. The Steady Pizza looks to be about the size of a mini fridge or an old-school CRT TV set. All the more reason to tip your driver extravagantly. Read more...More about Business and Marketing

Facebook has been evolving and if you ask the average small business owner, not all Facebook change is good change. When a platform's technology is beyond your control, how do you adapt your business strategy to keep up? I asked eight startup founders from Young Entrepreneur Council (YEC) how they have improved Facebook engagement, even in spite of recent algorithm changes that had some business owners running to other platforms. Here's what they had to say: See also: 8 Creative Uses for Twitter You've Never Tried 1. Integrated approach A few years ago we relied heavily on fan page interactions. Now with the changes made we have seen dramatic drops in engagement through Facebook for our brand. To counter this we have taken a more integrated approach with all our social networks and started to use pins and tweets in A/B tests to gauge fan interactions. If something catches the attention of viewers, then we also share it on Facebook.— Jerry Piscitelli, Portopong LLC Read more...More about Startup, Small Business, Facebook Marketing, Yec, and Business

Amazon recently won a patent for perhaps the most commonly used photography technique around: snapping a picture of an object against a white background. But according to experts, the patent isn't exactly what it seems and shouldn't have as much of a profound impact on photographers as they think. The news of the patent win first surfaced about two weeks ago, and the resulting uproar focused on supposed ownership of a basic technique. Technically, it could mean Amazon has license to sue anyone shooting a catalog. See also: The 18 Most Important Features in iOS 8 Not surprisingly, photographers are not happy. In fact, there's already a petition circulating with nearly 45,000 signatures asking the US Patent and Trademark Office to appeal the parent.

With the proliferation of tools for both measuring and automating your marketing efforts, startups aren't exactly wanting for real-time marketing data. But while spreadsheets and dashboards are nice, actually being able to prove your marketing works is far more useful. See also: 10 Ways to Boost Sales on Your Ecommerce Website Interested in how other startups are measuring their marketing efforts, I asked a group of entrepreneurs from Young Entrepreneur Council to share how they currently track their successes (and failures). Their best responses are below: 1. Tracking Now that high-quality content has so many benefits in the marketing world, it's important to track all its different uses. For example, when you share specific pieces of content, use Buffer to track it. Or, when you send someone an email that includes a specific type of content, use HubSpot or Infusionsoft to track the results. It can be as simple as tracking the clicks on your recent post that's in your signature line.- John Hall, Influence & Co.

Thanks to Amazon's teaser video, the company's mysterious June 18 product announcement may not be so mysterious after all. On Wednesday, Amazon announced plans to introduce a new product later this month.

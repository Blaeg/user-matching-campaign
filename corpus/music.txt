Jimmy Iovine has been touting the need for better curation in music streaming for more than a year. Iovine noted in February 2013 that Apple, Google and Facebook have plenty of data on their users' musical tastes, "but no one is using [that data] to curate." And he argued the point again last month, on the same day it was announced that the first of those three companies would be buying Beats, the business Iovine cofounded with Dr. Dre. "What's going on with some of these other services is they're purely based on algorithms, and algorithms can't do the job alone," Iovine said during an interview at Recode's Code Conference. "So what happens is you have young people listening to certain radio stations on the Internet, right, and for some reason they just don't understand why they're not getting the feel they're supposed to get, so it's not all the hype they heard about quote, music."

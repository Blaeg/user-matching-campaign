The race for bigger, sharper screens, it seems, is never-ending. Whether the device in question fits in your pocket or hangs on your wall, manufacturers just keep cramming pixels in, even well past the point where our eyes can supposedly tell the difference. The LG G3 is just the latest embodiment of this trend. It's the first smartphone to boast a Quad HD display, which somehow stuffs more pixels than are on your average laptop into a 5.5-inch screen. The rated resolution is 2,560 x 1,440, or 538 pixels per inch (ppi). To put that in perspective, the supposedly "retina" iPhone 5S has a pixel density of 326 ppi.

The search giant will debut a health platform at its Google I/O conference for developers later this month, according to Forbes. Google Fit is rumored to collect and aggregate data from fitness trackers (think Jawbone and Fitbit), as well as other health-related apps.

Samsung launched on Thursday perhaps the most direct competitor to the iPad we've seen yet. In fact, the new Samsung Galaxy Tab S comes in a larger and smaller size too, just like its Apple counterpart. Both versions of the iPad (the mini and the standard 9.7-inch size) have the same display resolution, processor and storage space as the other (just the size is different), while specs built into the 8.4-inch and 10.5-inch Galaxy Tab devices largely go hand-in-hand too.

As with the shrooms in the original Plants vs. Zombies, these little fungi start very small, giving only 25 sun each. But they’ll grow over the course of the match to two additional sizes, each giving the player more sun to work with Read more...More about Mobile, Entertainment, Gaming, Smartphone, and E3

Samsung may have just delivered the first true challengers to the Apple iPad Air and iPad Mini With Retina Display: The Samsung Galaxy Tab S. The Galaxy Tab S describes two tablets, one 10.5 inches ($499) and the other 8.4 inches ($399), with the exact same internal specs and features.

Apple's dominance of the tablet market is so overwhelming that most other players in the space tend to "counter-program." Rather than try to match the iPad feature-for-feature or spec-for-spec, they go out of their way to differentiate and offer features the iPad simply doesn't have. Amazon's Kindle Fire tablets, for instance, are really virtual storefronts for the company's popular services. The Microsoft Surface line offers (more or less) a full PC experience in a tablet form factor, complete with a Desktop. See also: 25 Best Free Android Apps Even Samsung, Apple's most reliable hardware rival, plays the counter-programming game. For the past two years, Samsung has shined a spotlight on its Galaxy Note line of tablets, whose claim to fame is a digital pen, and all the cool things you can do with it (such as marking up maps with handwritten directions).

Until now, Samsung has kept SuperAMOLED displays only in phones. Read more...More about Samsung, Tablets, Galaxy Tab, Tech, and Gadgets

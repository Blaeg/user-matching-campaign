In the 1988 sci-fi flick They Live, a local drifter named John Nada stumbles upon a magic pair of sunglasses that give him the ability to see aliens. Turns out, the entire ruling class in America are nothing but aliens disguised as humans, and they're controlling society through subliminal messages in TV ads. Being both an action film and the '80s, it takes a predictable turn: Nada grabs a shotgun, flips on his shades and restores democratic order, all while coining the catchphrase, "I have come here to chew bubblegum and kick ass. And I'm all out of bubblegum." There's "Nada" flaw in the entire film. Read more...More about Videos, Lists, Features, Tech, and Wearable Tech

Veterans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki resigned on Friday after meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House. Shinseki's departure comes after days of withering criticism from across the political spectrum, as scores of senators called for him to step down amid growing allegations of misconduct at VA branches throughout the country. Obama, speaking at a White House press conference, said he accepted Shinseki's resignation "with considerable regret." Sloan Gibson, who was deputy secretary of veterans affairs, will now serve as the acting secretary, Obama said. Shinseki, a retired four-star general, had already come under scrutiny for initial allegations that 40 veterans had died while they were on a secret appointment waiting list at the Phoenix VA medical center that was meant to cover up the amount of time it took for veterans to land a checkup.

The Livestrong Foundation gained a badly needed champion over the weekend when Ryan Hunter-Reay — the hard-charging driver nicknamed “Captain America” — won his first Indianapolis 500 in jaw-dropping fashion. The cancer-patient crusading foundation suffered a huge PR blow in 2012, when founder and board chairman Lance Armstrong resigned after being stripped of his Tour de France victories for doping. The erstwhile Lance Armstrong Foundation rebranded as Livestrong, and said it was “charting a strong, independent course forward,” but the damage was done: Nike cut ties, and the organization was left without a high-profile face.

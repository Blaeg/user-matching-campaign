Everything is a little different down in Brazil. Samba and soccer rule the cultural imagination. Politics are rather more sharply drawn, as is the clash between wealth and poverty. The water rotates in the opposite direction when you flush. And topsy-turvey upsets, huge, dramatic reversals of fortune, can strike at any time. Brazil learned that lesson the hard way back in 1950, when it last hosted a World Cup and made it to the final, only to be outdrawn by its tiny neighbor, long-time rival and first World Cup winner, Uruguay. On Saturday, in a moment of sweet revenge for Brazil, Uruguay learned that lesson on Brazilian soil, suffering a shock 3-1 defeat to CONCAF minnows Costa Rica Read more...More about Entertainment, 2014 World Cup Brazil, and Sports

MANAUS, Brazil — Back in 2013, before this summer's World Cup groups and match-ups had been set, England manager Roy Hodgson called Manaus "ideally the place to avoid."

Hodgson backtracked on his comments, deeming them irrelevant in a press conference at Arena da Amazonia Friday But after England's opening game against Italy Saturday, it seems Hodgson was right all along See also: Humans of the World Cup: Match Day in Manaus Mario Balotelli headed home the game-winning goal.

For most of my time at E3, I roamed the showroom floor. Sometimes, I ducked into a closed-door demo; other times, I tested out indie creations with developers explaining their concepts. The whole experience was loud. Overwhelming. Chaotic. So when I sat down in a nearly empty room for an hour to play The Witness, the highly anticipated sophomore game from Jonathan Blow, the first thing that struck me was the quiet. This is a game of patience and focus See also: E3 2014: The Games We Really Want to Play Image: The WitnessTo begin, there’s no guide or text to explain your goals when you drop into this world. No wisecracking companion, and not even a thought bubble from my character. For about 20 seconds, I wondered if this game was going to be too opaque, too abstract for my mental state at the time. Then, I was nonverbally presented with the controls in the shortest, simplest tutorial I’ve ever seen, and released into the game Read more...More about Video Games, E3, Entertainment, Gaming, and Apps Software

MANAUS, Brazil — After arrival in this remote metropolis surrounded by jungle, you quickly sense only the thinnest of margins separates the real Manaus from the idyllic, festive World Cup bubble FIFA and the Brazilian government have improbably concocted, accessible only by boat or airplane Arena da Amazonia is the nearly $300 million dollar stadium that three workers died building; it will go mostly unused after hosting four tournament matches. The side streets immediately adjacent to it are jubilantly decorated. What would be drab and dirty pavement and sidewalks are painted in the Brazilian flag's vibrant blue, green and yellow as plastic streamers flutter overhead.

If you're a World Cup newcomer, or a skeptical holdout looking for reasons to jump into this tournament the rest of the world seems to be embracing, you're in luck.

"No one ever said on her death bed, 'I wish I'd spent more time on Facebook,'" says attorney and media correspondent Lisa Bloom A more likely scenario: regret that she didn't do more to save her grandchildren from rising carbon dioxide levels, because she was too busy scrolling her News Feed and flipping through Us Weekly. Bloom believes Western society's current preoccupation with trivial celebrity gossip and insipid social media — and the time we waste with it — will be its downfall. As our fascination for easy entertainment increases, our investment in global affairs decreases. In particular, women should do more to fight climate change; it is a uniquely women's issue, she says. They are innately suited to battle climate problems, some would argue better than men. Read more...More about Entertainment, Climate Change, Features, Women, and Gender
